    "instruction":"The following question is relevant to Computer Networks:\nHow does the TCP sender react to an ACK with an ECE congestion indication?",
    "output":"The TCP sender reacts to an ACK with an ECE congestion indication by halving the congestion window, as it would react to a lost segment using fast retransmit, and sets the CWR (Congestion Window Reduced) bit in the header of the next transmitted TCP sender-to-receiver segment.\n",

    "output":"The three questions are: how does a TCP sender limit the rate at which it sends traffic into its connection, how does a TCP sender perceive that there is congestion on the path between itself and the destination, and what algorithm should the sender use to change its send rate as a function of perceived end-to-end congestion.\n",

    "instruction":"The following question is relevant to Computer Networks:\nWhat is the recipe to define subnets in a general interconnected system of routers and hosts?",
    "output":"To determine the subnets, detach each interface from its host or router, creating islands of isolated networks, with interfaces terminating the end points of the isolated networks. Each of these isolated networks is called a subnet.\n",
