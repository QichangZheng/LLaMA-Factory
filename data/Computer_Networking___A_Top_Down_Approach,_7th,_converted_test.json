    "instruction":"The following question is relevant to Computer Networks:\nWhat is the path an email message takes when it is sent from one user to another, and why is it done in two steps?",
    "output":"The email message is first sent from the sender's user agent to the sender's mail server using SMTP, and then the sender's mail server uses SMTP to relay the message to the recipient's mail server. This two-step procedure is done so that the sender's mail server can repeatedly try to send the message to the recipient's mail server if it is unreachable.\n",

    "instruction":"The following question is relevant to Computer Networks:\nDoes a node take into account any collisions that may have occurred in the recent past when preparing a new frame for transmission?",
    "output":"No, each time a node prepares a new frame for transmission, it runs the CSMA\/CD algorithm without taking into account any collisions that may have occurred in the recent past.\n",

    "instruction":"The following question is relevant to Computer Networks:\nWhat is the process of registering with the Home Agent in mobile IP?",
    "output":"The process involves four steps: the mobile node sends a registration message to the foreign agent, the foreign agent sends a registration message to the home agent, the home agent checks for authenticity and correctness, and the home agent sends a registration reply to the foreign agent.\n",

    "output":"The straightforward approach is to build a single massive data center, store all videos in the data center, and stream the videos directly to clients worldwide. However, this approach has three major problems: server-to-client packets may cross many communication links, resulting in annoying freezing delays; popular videos will be sent many times over the same communication links, wasting network bandwidth; and a single data center represents a single point of failure.\n",
